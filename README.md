# HSR Layout Neighborhood Restaurant Map Project

ðŸŽ“[Part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Front--End%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg)

In this project, it's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes Google Maps and other location-based services like Zomato.

Included is a list of my favorite restaurants  in the HSR Layout Neighborhood of Bengaluru (India).

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map.

There's also extra info pulled from Zomato where available. This includes rating and address of the restaurant and also an option to order food online.

The app is responsive, too! It resizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries.

It can recalibrate itself based on your screen size -- try resizing the window! ðŸ–¥ ðŸ“²


# How To Use:

3. Type in the white bar if you only want to see a few of the places listed on the map to make it easier to spot.
