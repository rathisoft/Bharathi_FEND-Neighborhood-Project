# HSR Layout Neighborhood Restaurant Map Project

ðŸŽ“[Part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Front--End%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg)

In this project, it's intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes Google Maps and other location-based services like Zomato.

Included is a list of my favorite restaurants  in the HSR Layout Neighborhood of Bengaluru (India).

The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map.

Information also includes rating and address of the restaurant and also an option to check their menu.

All the info about the restaurant are provided live by the API of Zomato.com and thanks to them for providing the same.

The app is responsive, too! It resizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries.

It can recalibrate itself based on your screen size -- try resizing the window! ðŸ–¥ ðŸ“²
